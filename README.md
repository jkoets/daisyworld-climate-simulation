Welcome to the Daisyworld Climate Simulation! This educational tool demonstrates how life and climate interact to create a self-regulating system. Based on James Lovelock's Gaia Theory, this simulation shows how simple daisies of different colors can regulate a planet's temperature through their albedo (reflectivity) properties.

Teaches:
- How feedback loops work in climate systems
- The concept of planetary self-regulation
- The relationship between albedo and temperature
- Climate tipping points and system limits

Teacher guide included. The program is a single HTML file; just plop it on a web server.
